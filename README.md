We believe that individuals with ADHD have foraging strategies that strongly differ from those of neurotypical individuals, thus showing effective problem-solving strategies and providing innovation.To understand the influence of attention disorders on exploration / exploitation strategies, we created a serious game immersing the player in a realistic environment. The player is assigned with a simple task - that of collecting as many mushrooms as possible in a limited time and space frame. By varying parameters such as mushroom repartition or distraction levels, we wish to study attention fluctuations and describe working conditions in which individuals with ADHD are working at their fullest potential.We are leading our cognitive experiment on a small non-clinical sample before moving on to more significant clinical data. With sufficient data, our study could switch mentalities on a bigger scale around what is considered as a disability but could be valued as an asset and a part of natural neurodiversity.
